MobCAT
https://github.com/xamcat/mobcat-library

MobCAT is a toolbox created by our team to highlight and support the application
of best practices and good architectural patterns for Xamarin.Forms, Xamarin.Android,
and Xamarin.iOS apps.

These projects can provide a foundation or light-weight starting point which can
be built upon when adopted as part of your Xamarin solutions.

The projects themselves are .NET Standard portable projects. The intent is
that the source is cloned/forked and incorporated into your solutions directly
through project reference or via a private NuGet feed. Please refer to the
Getting Started Guide for more information.
